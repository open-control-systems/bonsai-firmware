//! Base class for non-copyable objects.
//!
//! @note
//!  - Template allows instantiate distinct non-copyable bases when
//!    they are inherited by multiple paths. We need this to
//!    eliminate compiler warnings "inaccessible direct base...".
//!
//!  - If any of the copy operations is declared, then none of the move operation
//!    will be generated, thus non-copyable object will become non-movable. It
//!    can become moveable only when move operations are declared explicitly.
