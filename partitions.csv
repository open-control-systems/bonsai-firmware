# The partition table length is 0xC00 bytes, as we allow a maximum of 95 entries.
# An MD5 checksum, used for checking the integrity of the partition table at runtime,
# is appended after the table data. Thus, the partition table occupies an entire flash
# sector, which size is 0x1000 (4 KB). As a result, any partition following it must be
# at least located at (default offset) + 0x1000.
#
# See the reference: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/partition-tables.html#overview

# Default address selection.
#
# By default the address of the partition table is 0x8000. It's been decided to use 0xF000
# as the default partition table address. This gives more space for the bootloader which may
# grow with new ESP-IDF versions.
#
# See the reference: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/kconfig.html#config-partition-table-offset

# Offset and size selection.
#
# Partition with "app" type must be aligned to the 0x10000.
